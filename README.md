## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I strengthened my understanding of CSS custom properties for easier color management and learned the importance of mobile-first responsive design. I also practiced using Flexbox to center elements within a page.

Here’s a piece of CSS I’m particularly proud of:

```css
.card {
    width: 300px;
    height: 490px;
    background-color: var(--White);
    border-radius: 20px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to focus more on accessibility and performance optimization. I also want to deepen my knowledge of CSS Grid for more complex layouts and explore modern frameworks like React to manage larger projects more efficiently.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand Flexbox and how to align elements easily in the center of the page.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - Great resource for learning about CSS variables and improving the maintainability of stylesheets.
